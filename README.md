# Doll Directory

A website created for the doll customising community, bringing the different aspects of the hobby together

## User Story

AS A doll customiser
I WANT a place where I can see and post doll content
SO THAT I don't have to access multiple apps/sites

## MVP

A website that I can upload photos and written posts to and look at other Users photos and written posts.

DB: MongoDB
API: GraphQL
Name: Doll Directory
Concept:
A website for the Doll Customising community.
You will be able to select if your interest is in Ball Jointed Dolls (Artist sculpted resin or vinyl dolls),
One Of A Kind Custom Playline Dolls (for example: barbie, monster high, rainbow high dolls - dolls that can be brought in toystores) or both and the site will tailor its content for your preference.
The home page will have a feed of the most recent photos and blogs.
One Of A Kind Custom Playline Doll Users:
Users will be able to post blogs and photos and have a personal dashboard (similar concept to instagram).
Directory of playline dolls, showing factory fullset, blank dolls, wiped faces - users can submit additional dolls.

Ball Jointed Doll Users:
Users will be able to post blogs and photos and have a personal dashboard (similar concept to instagram).

Artists will be able to record sales, buyers, serial numbers and additional details for legitimacy reference in the secondhand market.
Buyers can submit to artists if they have purchased a secondhand doll with the details for addition to the sales records and make requests to the artist for confirmation of legitimacy prior to purchase.

Future state:
direct messaging,
auctions/stores,
short video uploads,
Directory of BJD Artist dolls - sculpt, artist, genre - need artist permissions/participation to post.
BJD dimensions/sizing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
